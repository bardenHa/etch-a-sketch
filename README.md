Task:
--
Recreating etch-a-sketch with the main focus being on using DOM manipulation in javascript.
Project insights:
--
- Gained initial experience with DOM manipulation
- Learned how to create/remove child elements in JS
- More confident with JS basics
- Took a 2 month break from coding so needed refresh my memory for a few things 
- Project went fairly smoothly and did not have any major problems 

Project probably took around 3 hours to complete (excluding the break) from start to finish
